		 </span>.The well-respected current-production <span class="a2"> <a href=" https://www.audiusa.com/us/web/en/models/a3/a3-sedan/2020/overview.html"> A3 sedan</a> </span> will soon be replaced by an all-new 2022 modelâ€”the company is skipping over the 2021 model year. From what we can tell so far the new A3 going to be a significant improvement over an already delightful and upscale sedan. German rivals such as the <span class="a3"> <a href="https://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/bmw/2-series-gran-coupe"> BMW 2-series Gran Coupe </a> and <a href="https://www.mbusa.com/en/vehicles/class/a-class/sedan"> the Mercedes-Benz A-class </a> </span> are fueling consumers' appetites for small, premium sedans so it's no wonder <b> Audi</b> is doubling down on its compact car and giving it a richer interior, advanced technology, and razor-sharp looks. A turbocharged four-cylinder engine, all-wheel drive, and a host of driver-assistance features are sure to make the <span class="a4" ><a href="https://www.audiusa.com/us/web/en/models/a3/a3-sedan/2020/overview.html"> A3 </a> </span> a desirable choice. We expect the A3 to launch in North America by the end of 2021 as a 2022 model.
